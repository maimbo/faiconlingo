# Duolingo for Schools - Summary

**What it is:**
Duolingo for Schools is a free administrative and educational platform built on top of the standard Duolingo language learning app. It is specifically designed to help teachers integrate digital language learning seamlessly into their classrooms.

**Main Features:**
*   **Classroom Management:** Teachers can create virtual classrooms, organize students into groups, and manage multiple classes entirely from a single, centralized dashboard.
*   **Student Progress Tracking:** It provides real-time visibility into student performance. Teachers can see experience points (XP) earned, lessons completed, accuracy, and the amount of time students spend studying.
*   **Personalized Assignments:** Educators can create specific assignments for their students, such as reaching a certain XP goal or completing a designated number of lessons, to guide their learning path.
*   **Gamified Experience:** Students use the same standard Duolingo app they might already be familiar with, benefiting from its engaging, game-like elements (streaks, rewards, leaderboards, and interactive exercises) which are proven to increase motivation.
*   **Flexible Account Integration:** The platform supports linking to existing student Duolingo accounts (so they don't lose their previous progress) or creating brand new ones for the class.
*   **Teacher Resources:** It offers a dedicated "Teacher Training" section with professional development resources, implementation guides, lesson ideas, and materials to help educators maximize the platform's effectiveness.

**Target Audience:**
It is designed primarily for K-12 and higher-education language teachers, as well as school administrators who are looking for free, high-quality, and engaging digital learning tools.

**Key Benefits:**
*   **100% Free:** The service is completely free for educators and classrooms, with no hidden costs for its core features.
*   **Increased Engagement:** By making language learning feel like a game, it helps keep students motivated and reduces the friction often associated with traditional language study.
*   **Data-Driven Instruction:** Detailed progress reports allow teachers to identify exactly where individual students are struggling or excelling, enabling more targeted interventions and support.
*   **Accessibility:** It works across multiple devices (web, iOS, Android), allowing students to practice comfortably both in the classroom and at home.
