# Where I am Now with the FiancoLingo App Proposal
* I am now fine tuning my pitch presentation ahead of a critical meeting with the client on Tuesday.
* It's make or break time. I have to show the client that I understand their needs and can deliver a world-class language learning and cultural preservation app, localised for Zambia, all within budget, time and very technologically sound(robust, scalable, and secure) and with very pleasing aesthetics and great user experience.

# A few more ideas on improving our app understanding and proposed demo concept
- We have to cater to tourists, visiting business people in a unique way. We have to create some lesson paths, scenarios, features and considerations for this 'unique' segment of our users. Somehow they are obviously slightly different from our own local Gen-Z, Millenial or other age groups, who are predominantly locals.
- In addition we need some features that can help educators and teachers to create and deliver lessons in a fun and engaging way. We need to create some interactive features that can help them create lessons and assessments that are engaging and interactive. The section **DuoLingo for Schools** in the document - inspiration\DuoLingo\lessons_from_duolingo.md, might give us some ideas.
- I have some more thoughts in the document - inspiration\DuoLingo\lessons_from_duolingo.md, that you can glean some critical aspects for our demo tomorrow.
