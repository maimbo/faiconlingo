- I need to get a bit more technical with this project from this point onwards
- Firstly note, that the mobile application will be developed in Flutter with Firebase backend. However, for the initial designs to quicken things I will use HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the conceptual designs/mockup as I have done already.
- Then the Flutter app will be based on these design guidelines. The final design may of course be slightly different due to differences in technologies. However, the web mockups will provide great vision and direction for the development process.
- Then secondly, I need to get into the weeds of everything that it takes to build a language learning app, and specifically how we shall build this one based on:- the baseline features highlighted by the client, our understanding of the client's needs, unique value proposition features, etc. Everything from architecture, workflows, algorithms; I mean everything about building a robust, scalable, maintainable, performant, secure, accessible, user-friendly, and engaging language learning app.
- Firsly sythensize all the the technical aspects from the presentations we have created, the mockups, etc into documents detailing the technical architecture and design of the app, the various components, modules/engines, algorithms, data structures, etc. Place these documents in the docs folder, under a sub-folder called - technical.
