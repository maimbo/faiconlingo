# PWA version
- Duolingo has a PWA version. 
- This caters for users who do not wish to install "just one more app" on their devices, but still want to use the app. 
- It addition it also makes offline access via web browsers on PCS, tablets and other devices possible. 
- PWA also tend to be cheaper at times, and much easier to :- access, update and maintain than native apps.
- PWA also tend to have a wider distribution, as they can be accessed via web browsers on PCS, tablets and other devices, and therefore not limited to a specific platform, like Android or iOS or Windows. 
- Further, they are not exclusive to any app store, and can be accessed directly from the web browser, making them more accessible to users who may not have access to app stores, or prefer not to use them. 


# Some Important Features

- **Onboarding**: Draw most the important lessons from screenshots I have taken of the app in - inspiration\DuoLingo\onboarding. Some of the ones I have kind of taken note of are:
    -- Nice, animated welcome to app with Duo mascot, animated characters related to the thematic concept or purpose of the app
    -- Language selection screen with options for the user to choose from
    -- Prominent interaction with app mascot - Duo, through the mascot guiding the user through the onboarding process, and providing helpful tips and information along the way.
    -- A nice, quick and short survey to get some valuable information from the user on - where they heard about the app
    -- Survey(contd). Why they are learning the language selected. What are their learning goals - to travel, to connect with family, for school, for work, for fun, etc.
    -- How much of the language they know
